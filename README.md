# Notes

As I did not develop the ReactWebClicker and AndroidGame projects on my own I will specify here what I worked on.  

## AndroidGame

This is an Android Studio project. I worked in a team of five to develop it. I worked on the following classes:

Activities:
* StartGame

GameObjects:
* Background 
* Bubble (I did not write this entirely on my own)  
* GameOver  
* Glass  
* Recipe (I did not write this entirely on my own)

PlayerData:  
* Players (I did not write this entirely on my own)  

Other:  
* BubbleGame  
* Game 

## reactWebClicker

I worked on this project with another student and I created most of the logic and some of the user interface.
